1.All the parts are solved in different folder Nameing: 
        dataset.py--> In Dataset folder
   
	(part1_a.py, part1_b.py)---> In Part 1 folder

        part2.py-->In part 2 folder
	

2.Change the path of taking input and the place where you want to save training and testing data

3.All the part for each question are cleary solved sepertely in the same .py document with proper headlines and comment.

4.Also I have attached fully excuted notebook code for each part naming with the same name and same folder with ".ipynb" extension.
