1.All the 5 questions are solved in different part Nameing: 
	A.py, B.py, C.py, D.py and E.py

2.Name of data set is 'AllBooks_baseline_DTM_Labelled.csv' ,to excute all this only change the path of 'AllBooks_baseline_DTM_Labelled.csv' in the initial of all five part.

3.All the part or each question are cleary solved sepertely in the same .py document with proper headlines and comment.

4. Clustres of different part is included in "clusters" folder with propely naming for each part in ".txt" file.
Name of clusters are: agglomerative.txt              ---> from Agglomerative Clustering 
	              kmeans.txt 		     ---> from kmeans clustring
		      kmeans_reduced.txt	     ---> from Kmeans Clustring on reduced data
		      agglomerative_reduced.txt	     ---> from Agglomerative Clustering on reduced data


5.
NMI score of agglomerative.txt :  1.8461794521809038
NMI score of kmeans.txt :  0.9187470250416958
NMI score of kmeans_reduced.txt :  1.0244221726618001
NMI score of agglomerative_reduced.txt :  1.8461794521809038



6.Also I have attached fully excuted notebook code for each part naming:
-->17CE10003_A.ipynb
-->17CE10003_B.ipynb
-->17CE10003_C.ipynb
-->17CE10003_D.ipynb
